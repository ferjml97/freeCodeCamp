## Certifications 
 
- ### Responsive Web Desing Certification 
 
  Status:   `üê±‚Äçüë§`
  
    <ul>
    <details open>
    <summary> Description </summary>

      In this Responsive Web Design Certification, you'll learn the languages that developers use to build webpages: 
      HTML (Hypertext Markup Language) for content, and CSS (Cascading Style Sheets) for design.
      First, you'll build a cat photo app to learn the basics of HTML and CSS. 
      Later, you'll learn modern techniques like CSS variables by building a penguin, 
      and best practices for accessibility by building a web form.

      Finally, you'll learn how to make webpages that respond to different screen sizes by 
      building a Twitter card with Flexbox, and a complex blog layout with CSS Grid.

    <ul>
    <details open>
    <summary> Description </summary>

      While HTML and CSS control the content and styling of a page, JavaScript is used to make it interactive. 
      In the JavaScript Algorithm and Data Structures Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of JavaScript 
      including variables, arrays, objects, loops, and functions.
      
      Once you have the fundamentals down, you'll apply that knowledge by creating algorithms to manipulate strings, 
      factorialize numbers, and even calculate the orbit of the International Space Station.
      
      Along the way, you'll also learn two important programming styles or paradigms: 
      Object Oriented Programming (OOP) and Functional Programming (FP).

    <ul>
    <details open>
    <summary> Description </summary>

      Data is all around us, but it doesn't mean much without shape or context.
      
      In the Data Visualization Certification, you'll build charts, graphs, 
      and maps to present different types of data with the D3.js library.
      
      You'll also learn about JSON (JavaScript Object Notation),
      and how to work with data online using an API (Application Programming Interface).

    <summary> Description </summary>

    
      Python is one of the most popular, flexible programming languages today. 
      You can use it for everything from basic scripting to machine learning.
      
      In the Scientific Computing with Python Certification, you'll learn Python fundamentals 
      like variables, loops, conditionals, and functions. Then you'll quickly ramp up to complex 
      data structures, networking, relational databases, and data visualization.

    <ul>
    <details open>
    <summary> Description </summary>

    
      Data Analysis has been around for a long time. But up until a few years ago, developers 
      practiced it using expensive, closed-source tools like Tableau. But recently, Python, SQL, 
      and other open libraries have changed Data Analysis forever.

      In the Data Analysis with Python Certification, you'll learn the fundamentals of data analysis 
      with Python. 
      
      By the end of this certification, you'll know how to read data from sources like CSVs and SQL, 
      and how to use libraries like Numpy, Pandas, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to process and visualize data.
